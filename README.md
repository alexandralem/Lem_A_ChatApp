A chat application which allows users to communicate with one another in real time. The app notifies the users when somebody enters and leaves the chat. It also shows when somebody is typing the message. In the side bar to the left all the users that are currently in the chat can be seen.


## Usage

Run 'npm install' in your terminal to install node modules, and then 'node app' to start the application. After that go to localhost:3000 and enjoy the application!
